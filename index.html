      <h2 id="title">PROMOTIONAL ARTICLE | GOLDENLEAF ACADEMY: A MODEST PROMOTION</h2>

      <p>Goldenleaf Academy is rooted deep in our country's history. Established more than a century ago in 1868, it is an institution that was among the first few to offer quality education for everyone. In the decades that it has been built, Goldenleaf Academy has garnered international acclaim and was given the title of The Center of Learning in Asia. Every year, it sends out countless students who win gold and silver medals in both national and international competitions.</p>

To support you in your academic journey, we at Goldenleaf Academy ensure that each and every student’s academic needs, including yours, are met. Students of Goldenleaf Academy receive up to 6,200 pesos allowance every month! Quite a catch, is it not? Additionally, Goldenleaf Academy ensures that its students are in the most well-suited learning environment possible.

Here, you will receive access to billions of opportunities in various academic fields that will help you become an important individual in this society. However, in the same way that our school is the best in the country, you must also put in work to become a person worthy of being called a student of this prestigious academy. To help you with this, we have prepared a series of guidelines that can turn you into a student capable of representing the values our school embodies - brilliance, greatness, and eminence. Please comply with the following suggestions to grow into the perfect student that society demands.</p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">1. Accept Constructive Criticism</h4>
      <p>As an academic institution, it is our responsibility to guide you, our students, to become the best individuals you can be. Do not cry when teachers loudly scold or criticize your looks, figure, feelings, differences, flaws, and mistakes. Remember, it is a part of learning!</p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">2. 24/7 Studying</h4>
      <p>DID YOU KNOW? According to our school’s research, studies showed that studying 24/7 can improve one’s mental capacity to store information and learn new things! It can also improve the student’s academic performance and strengthen their self-discipline and responsibility as a consequence of constant exposure to pressure.</p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">3. No Extracurricular Activities</h4>
      <p>To relieve students from getting distracted by such stressful and nonsensical hobbies and activities, Goldenleaf Academy makes sure that there are no extracurricular activities in the school. This means that clubs and other organizations are banned, while students are closely monitored to ensure that they don’t stray away from studying during their free time.</p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">4. No Sleep</h4>
      <p class="transition">Now, you may be thinking, why in the world should sleep be removed from the student’s daily routine? Well, that’s because Goldenleaf Academy believes that sleeping can be a waste of time. According to our computations, in one school year, there are 203 school days. An average person gets 8 hours of sleep per day. Knowing this, students get 1,624 hours of sleep per school year - hours which could be used for studying or fulfilling one’s academic requirements.</p>

      <p>Knowing these things, we hope that you will be able to strictly follow these friendly suggestions of ours in order for us to provide you a great-quality stay in Goldenleaf Academy. You see? It is as simple as that!</p>

      <p>Worried about the mental burden of an intense and rigorous curriculum? Have no fear! Goldenleaf Academy ensures that its students’ mental well-being is well-prioritized. Here in our institution, we not only give out surveys and conduct webinars weekly, but we also grant week-long mental health breaks.
      </p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">1. Bimonthly Surveys</h4>
      <p>Surveys are conducted once every two months to know about the situation of each student. With a large number of learners in this institution, the data gathered are most significantly used for academic and research purposes. If survey results cause public concern, Goldenleaf Academy will make sure to take necessary action <span class="cross-out">until the heat has died down</span>.</p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">2. Mental Health Webinars</h4>
      <p>To provide awareness and solutions to issues concerning one’s mental well- being, Goldenleaf Academy conducts webinars discussing various topics regarding mental health. During the discussion, students must stay seated and attentively listen to the speaker. This is to protect the students from additional, insignificant activities that could distract them from their studies. Application of the lessons shall be up to the students, though it is not recommended since topics under the curriculum are of higher priority. We also make sure to repeat topics to drill these pieces of information into the students’ minds.</p>

      <h4 class="article-numberings">4. Week-long Academic Breaks</h4>
      <p>Feeling like things are going a bit too fast? Don’t worry! Goldenleaf Academy makes sure to conduct mental health breaks - spanning one to two weeks - to give students time to breathe from the lessons held inside the classroom. Quite a long time, isn’t it?</p>

      <p class="transition">During mental health breaks, no classes will be held. Instead, activities shall be conducted to help students de-stress and relax. However, as much as we would like to provide the students with one to two weeks doing nothing, their academic responsibilities must still be fulfilled. Keep in mind that we are an institution that gives high regard to commitment, which is why we shall keep our promise of providing students with the highest quality education possible. Compliance with academic requirements will still be monitored and deadlines shall not be extended unless necessary.</p>

      <p>With these out of the way, it’s clear that Goldenleaf Academy is the number one choice for higher learning. Not only is it a highly prestigious institution, but it also values its students' well-being. A dream come true! So what are you waiting for, sign up now! Goldenleaf Academy is currently accepting applications until the first of next month. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to become part of the best school in the country. <em>Ad caelum et ultra!</em></p>
